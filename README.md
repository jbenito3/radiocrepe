# Radiocrepe


## Usage

Start a server:

    $ radiocrepe server -c config.ini

There is a `radiocrepe.ini` file in the source code that you can adapt to your needs.

If you have a last.fm API key you can use the option `lastfm_key` for extra awesomeness (pictures!)

Start a player somewhere else:

    $ radiocrepe player localhost:5000
